# Return to the Heartitorium

[TODO APA format]

## Introduction

[TODO 1-2 pages]

According to the best available records, "The Heartitorium" first appeared in
the Salt Lake Telegram on February 26, 1917. It advertised "ADVICE TO WOMEN AND
MEN WHO ARE TROUBLED" from a woman named Kathleen Kaye. Remnants of the
Heartitorium are very scarce online&mdash;neither the column nor Kaye is
documented on Wikipedia, for instance. Despite the column's depth and enduring
value to its community of readers, the most readily available (and perhaps,
only) external documentation of its existence is in a thesis from Utah State
University in 2014: "Sinners in the City of Saints: Flappers in Salt Lake
City." Analyzing it alongside the LDS church-affiliated *Young Woman's
Journal*, Bree Ann Romero wrote that the Heartitorium "reflected a secular map
of progressive expectations... in the nineteen twenties" (Romero, 2014, p. 14).

Romero's thesis goes on to highlight more and more facets of the Heartitorium as
an ecocompositional organism deserving of close rhetorical study.

* old generation creates social expectations of the younger
* the community is an evolving organism: through writings between Kaye and her readers,
  and also as the historical context changed (i.e. the war)
    * setting ladies up with soldier boys
    * can I find an example where she cites an audience writer to answer another writer's
      question
* literary sponsor: Kaye advising education to divorcees
    * a  writer always has more to learn (suggesting general education to the film
      enthusiast)
* 

**More from Romero**
p 29: (Start Romero Quote) "The Telegram columnists held girls and boys equally accountable for their youthful behavior.  A letter published on June 3, 1923 read, 

```
I have plenty of chances to go out with real nice fellows, but somehow I cannot have a good tim e . . .  I never want to go any place in particular, an d nothing sounds like fun anymore. But if I stay home, I get lonesome and blue, and want to cry and I don’t know why.  ”
```
Responding, Kaye asked, 

```
Disillusioned so soon? What have you done, poor child? Have you played the game of life too hard — struck down deep and found it empty ?”
```

Kaye advised the “ poor little twentieth century whirlwind ” to e xamine her clouded conscious . Did artificial stimulation obstruct the otherwise beautiful opport unities provided by youth? H ad physical neglect occasioned the empt iness? Whatever the reason, Kaye held the young woman accountable for her sorrow."

(End Romero Quote)

Is this an example of upbraiding someone who had depression in a time when it was stigmatized? Probably!

p 34-35: (Start Romero quote)
" The secular press advocated a more comprehensive form of women’s education, albeit unconv entionally at times .  Telegram writers , for instance, censured girls for expressing interest in movie careers over continued
schooling. A writer asked, “What should I do?” She dreamed of being a film star and failed to see how an education might
benefit her .
Kaye replied, 
```
“Sunshine, dear,
it matters n ot what your interests now are . . .
there’s but one foundation upon which real success may be laid, and that is a thorough
general education. Not pleasing to your fancy, perhaps, but facts are stubborn, an
d this one rings true.
”
```

Other readers complained of schoolroom boredom, to which Kaye issued stern instructions to stay the course because “h igh school, university or college credentials are the be st weapons” with which a girl could arm herself.

... 

When unhappy wives , for instance, asked how they might support themselves in the event of divorce, education w as always the first suggestion of each columnist. Contrary to the Journal’s position, e ducation served the individual needs and interests of women, according to Kaye and Blair. "
(End Romero quotes)


While Romero gives many compelling observations on the Heartitorium and its like, one must imagine that comprehensive research on such written materials would be a herculean task. Romero believes (not unfoundedly) that the Heartitorium was more progressive than its counterparts with more direct roots in the LDS church. Still, one might ask, how do we *really* know? Could we produce convincing evidence to compare the social impacts of these community-driven publications?

(trends in what folx writing in talk about, maybe)
(do they mention the impacts of the column on their lives)

[TODO State an overarching argument about literary practices in Heartitorium community]

[TODO How does the argument further writing & rhetoric studies? With the
digital turn in college libraries, Quantitative analysis, corpus linguistics,
could be made available to students.]

## Research Methods

[TODO] A description of the research site.

[TODO] A description of the nature and frequency of your data collection (i.e., your observations and participation).

[TODO] A description of your process for data analysis.

Using the Natural Language ToolKit, it is trivial to produce what is known as a "concordance" of a specific word. That is, a list of occurrances of that word, given in context.

Here are two examples of such concordances displayed in a command-line terminal. The first displays contexts in which the word "boy" occurs, and the second displays the same for the word "girl."

![Figure 1](concordance-fig.png)

![Figure 2](concordance-fig2.png)

[TODO] A discussion of how your own identities, positionality, and prior knowledge of/participation in the community have informed your data collection and analysis.

[TODO] A discussion of how you have addressed issues of research ethics in this study (e.g. forming ethical research relationships, protecting confidentiality, etc.)

[1-2 pages]

## Limitations

[TODO] with the ability to zero in on topics and words, it is easier and more tempting to pursue a specific thesis and fall into confirmation bias. Possibly counteract this by concentrated search for counter-evidence as well.

[TODO] if initial research is conducted from nltk without first browsing the column organically, this is an even greater threat
 

## Findings

[4-6 pages]

    [TODO] present the key points you are making in support of your overarching argument, and those points should be backed up with specific evidence (e.g. direct quotes, description, images, and/or narrative) from your observations and participation in the community.


* cute writer names like "A BUGLER"... will these be identifiable in the OCR at
  all?


**Specific Documents**

https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=20023455
- girl asks if it's proper to refuse when a boy asks to dance.
Kaye says: as long as you've been properly introduced and he's your age, you're only justified in saying no if there's misconduct on his part

https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=20023455
Kaye says don't make the mistake of seeming too eager for any man's love

https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=10188093
Someone asking Kaye about patriotic movie production companies! Very WSP!

if you could get a boy, you'd be with a soldier boy
 
## Conclusion

[1-2 pages]
[TODO] remind the reader of your big argument and help them understand what that argument contributes to our understanding of writing as a social practice. An effective conclusion will answer the âso what?â? question: why does your argument matter? What are the implications for the field? For society?

[TODO] what would heartitorium look like today?
    * maybe Savage Love or Modern Love
    * more woke, i.e. Would the modern version of Heartitorium put a lonely trans girl in touch with a lesbian soldier? Is there an example of a publication like that?
    * cite saga column

Readers and users of texts have as much to do with
a text becoming an instance of a genre as writers do (NWWK 40). This is so the case with Heartitorium

recognizing the intertextual nature of meaning
making is the vital first step toward developing theoretical perspectives
and methodological approaches for tracing the textual connections per-
sons and collectives employ in the continual making and remaking of
knowledge, selves, and societies. (NWWK 46). heartitorium = making and remaking of selves and societies!!


## Disorganized Notes

* It's sad that we don't have the original hand-written reader letters. (Were they all hand-written?)
* Ran searches for 'boy' and 'girl'-- why not cars, sports, gambling, poker, alcohol (temperance!)
* Read Flower and Hayes 1981
* Letters are handwritten but they appear in the column typed. Is Kaye *editing* them? i.e. Does she remove mistakes or correct grammar?! That would be very significant to know. Also, how does she choose worthy letters? Is the community small enough to answer 100%?
* Sad footnote: the modern-day "woker" equivalent is probably the letter columns in Brian K Vaughan's comics. Exchanges have appeared about abortion, adultery, trans issues, etc. but I don't think anyone has ever been *set up* by Vaughan
* Did Heartitorium reflect/affect the journalistic practices at the Telegram? When it appeared in the Herald-Republican temporarily, what was that about?
* Some Heartitorium documents are so rich a paper could focus on just one of them.
* NWWK pg 42-43: Writing is multimodal. Talk about how Heartitorium mastheads, and diagrams (even of proper manners) show that
* NWWK pg 43-44: Writing is performative. Are the readers performing for Kaye when they write in? How do they want to come across?
* Has anyone ever written into the Heartitorium **severely** emotional? Mad at Kaye, or having suicidal thoughts? These things happen to modern online communities. Would sentiment analysis be possible on the corpus?
* The Journal of Open Research Software might publish something about the UDN OCR tools if I can open-source them.
