# Return to the Heartitorium

[TODO APA format]

**Introduction**

[TODO 1-2 pages]

According to the best available records, "The Heartitorium" first appeared in
the Salt Lake Telegram on February 26, 1917. It advertised "ADVICE TO WOMEN AND
MEN WHO ARE TROUBLED" from a woman named Kathleen Kaye. Remnants of the
Heartitorium are very scarce online&mdash;neither the column nor Kaye is
documented on Wikipedia, for instance. Despite the column's depth and enduring
value to its community of readers, the most readily available (and perhaps,
only) external documentation of its existence is in a thesis from Utah State
University in 2014: "Sinners in the City of Saints: Flappers in Salt Lake
City." Analyzing it alongside the LDS church-affiliated *Young Woman's
Journal*, Bree Ann Romero wrote that the Heartitorium "reflected a secular map
of progressive expectations... in the nineteen twenties" (Romero, 2014, p. 14).

Romero's thesis goes on to highlight more and more facets of the Heartitorium as
an ecocompositional organism deserving of close rhetorical study.

* old generation creates social expectations of the younger
* the community is an evolving organism: through writings between Kaye and her readers,
  and also as the historical context changed (i.e. the war)
    * setting ladies up with soldier boys
    * can I find an example where she cites an audience writer to answer another writer's
      question
* literary sponsor: Kaye advising education to divorcees
    * a  writer always has more to learn (suggesting general education to the film
      enthusiast)
* 

While Romero gives many compelling observations on the Heartitorium and its like, one must imagine that comprehensive research on such written materials would be a herculean task. Romero believes (not unfoundedly) that the Heartitorium was more progressive than its counterparts with more direct roots in the LDS church. Still, one might ask, how do we *really* know? Could we produce convincing evidence to compare the social impacts of these community-driven publications?

[TODO State an overarching argument about literary practices in Heartitorium
community]

[TODO How does the argument further writing & rhetoric studies? With the
digital turn in college libraries, Quantitative analysis, corpus linguistics,
could be made available to students.]

**Research Methods**

[TODO] A description of the research site.
[TODO] 
[TODO] A description of the nature and frequency of your data collection (i.e., your observations and participation).
[TODO] 
[TODO] A description of your process for data analysis.
[TODO] A discussion of how your own identities, positionality, and prior knowledge of/participation in the community have informed your data collection and analysis.
[TODO] A discussion of how you have addressed issues of research ethics in this study (e.g. forming ethical research relationships, protecting confidentiality, etc.)
[TODO] 
[1-2 pages]

**Limitations**

[TODO] with the ability to zero in on topics and words, it is easier and more tempting to pursue a specific thesis and fall into confirmation bias. Possibly counteract this by concentrated search for counter-evidence as well.

[TODO] if initial research is conducted from nltk without first browsing the column organically, this is an even greater threat
 

**Findings**

[4-6 pages]
    [TODO] present the key points you are making in support of your overarching argument, and those points should be backed up with specific evidence (e.g. direct quotes, description, images, and/or narrative) from your observations and participation in the community.


* cute writer names like "A BUGLER"... will these be identifiable in the OCR at
  all?
 
**Conclusion**

[1-2 pages]
[TODO] remind the reader of your big argument and help them understand what that argument contributes to our understanding of writing as a social practice. An effective conclusion will answer the “so what?” question: why does your argument matter? What are the implications for the field? For society?

[TODO] what would heartitorium look like today?
    * maybe Savage Love or Modern Love
    * more woke, i.e. Would the modern version of Heartitorium put a lonely trans girl in touch with a lesbian soldier? Is there an example of a publication like that?
